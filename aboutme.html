            <h1>First Memories</h1>
            <p>I think my first memory as a child was when my mom was pregnant with the twins, I woke up and Aunt Phyllis was at the house because Dad had taken her to the hospital. The next earliest childhood memory I have was my sister Gae Nell went to live with my Aunt Nellie to help Mom and Dad out with all the mouths that they had to feed. Eventually Gae Nell came home to live. Then as luck would have it my next memory was my dad slamming his fist against the side of our house because he thought that she had died when in reality she had trouble with her thyroids and the doctors had a hard time figuring it out.</<p>
